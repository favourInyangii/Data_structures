# problem1
A set of arrays was giving to set1 and set2, which were both integers.They were used to get the sum of the distinct elemnent. The FOR-LOOP was used to pass each of the array to get the sum.
#problem2
A function and procedure was used to determine the dot product of v1 and v2. vector1 and vector2 are both array of integer. The vector pairs being equal to the dot_product_result means its orthogonal.
